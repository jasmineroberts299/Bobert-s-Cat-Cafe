<main><p>Thank you for visiting Bobert's Cat Cafe's about page! Bobert's Cat Cafe was founded in 1809 by 
Marjorine Bobert. She was known for having way too many cats. For generations Bobert's Cat Cafe has been
 a family owned business and will continue to be operated and owned within the family. Currently, Butterine
Bobert runs the business and she loves every bit of it!</p><p>The mission of Bobert's Cat Cafe is to provide
a wonderful cat experience and to serve the best coffee and bagels in town! What's life without a little
furry companion to purr in your ear while you sip your morning/evening joe? Plus, with wonderful benefits
like ours, you'll be sure to make this your first stop of the day!</p>
